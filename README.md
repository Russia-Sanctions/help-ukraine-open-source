# List of open source projects aimed at helping Ukraine and Ukrainians during this conflict

#### I am selecting the ones that have at least a reasonable web or product working in production and straightforward enough that I could explain to my grandma. I see projects related to blockchain and cyberwarfare. I am staying clear of these repos for the simple reason that I don't understand what's going on inside. These are the ones I have found so far, please add more to the list if you find them üôè

## Help people fleeing war

    - Website: [europratsya.vercel.app](https://europratsya.vercel.app/)
    - The goal of this project is to help Ukrainians citizens:
      - Get their CV's translated;
